The lights are out
The cats are hungry
The room is full of gangsters

<|endoftext|>

The dishes are dirty
The icebox is empty
I dream of celery and a compass

<|endoftext|>

The roof is upstairs
The window next door
A guitar in the shower

<|endoftext|>

The hours disappear in my room
Where is my blue pistol
The door-god is knocking.

<|endoftext|>

Eastern guard tower
glints in sunset; convicts rest
like lizards on rocks.

The piano man
is stingy, at 3 A.M.
his songs drop like plum.

Morning sun slants cell.
Drunks stagger like cripple flies
On jailhouse floor.

To write a blues song
is to regiment riots
and pluck gems from graves.

A bare pecan tree
slips a pencil shadow down
a moonlit snow slope.

<|endoftext|>

The falling snow flakes
Cannot blunt the hard aches nor
Match the steel stillness.

Under moon shadows
A tall boy flashes knife and
Slices star bright ice.

In the August grass
Struck by the last rays of sun
The cracked teacup screams.

Seventeen syllables AIN’T

After the sewage flowed into the sea
and took the oxygen away, the fishes fled,
but the jellies didn’t mind. They stayed
and ate up the food the fishes left behind.
I sat on the beach in my red pajamas
and listened to the sparkling foam,
like feelings being fustigated. Nearby,
a crayfish tugged on a string. In the distance,
a man waved. Unnatural cycles seemed to be
establishing themselves, without regard to our lives.
Deep inside, I could feel a needle skip:
Autumn dark.
Murmur of the saw.
Poor humans.

A piece of green pepper

Picture a woman
riding thunder on
the legs of slavery

<|endoftext|>

Picture her kissing
our spines saying no to
the eyes of slavery

<|endoftext|>

Picture her rotating
the earth into a shape
of lives becoming

<|endoftext|>

Picture her leaning
into the eyes of our
birth clouds

<|endoftext|>

Picture this woman
saying no to the constant
yes of slavery

<|endoftext|>

Picture a woman
jumping rivers her
legs inhaling moons

<|endoftext|>

Picture her ripe
with seasons of
legs running

<|endoftext|>

Picture her tasting
the secret corners
of woods

<|endoftext|>

Picture her saying:
You have within you the strength,
the patience, and the passion
to reach for the stars,
to change the world


<|endoftext|>

caged by dappled light
unlike Rilke’s beastcontent

perennial green

red roof in full leaf

Clouds murmur darkly,
it is a blinding habit—

Spring means plum blossoms
and spotless new kimonos
for holiday whores.

<|endoftext|>

Once more as I wait
for you, night and icy wind
melt into cold rain.

<|endoftext|>

In the spring of joy,
when even the mud chuckles,
my soul runs rabid,
snaps at its own bleeding heels,
and barks: “What is happiness?”

She never saw fire

O fierce Oghuz, tie me to two wild elephants, tear me in half

O my swarthy herder, two-humped bactrian, drive me the long

Forceps, tongs, bushi, whip, flanks, scabbard, stirrup, goads,

distaff, wither, awl

Black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne's lace, bounty of cyclamen,
mown paths erupt

In fat armchairs sat
indolence and impatience,

A wicked cage flew

I burned with love in

tired profligate, I

thinking of all the

glossy old bunnies

I imagine their

his tongue slithers, gaunt

it is dark in there

I will crush the glass
with the fingers in his back
and pile on my rings

<|endoftext|>

and all the fur coats
and move down the circular
stairs, bloated with gold

<|endoftext|>

the flowers are a

flames and noxious breath

his betrayal gives
me granite fists, girls scatter
movie stars crumple

I’ll sue him and write

After wandering years
Basho returned
to gaze at his umbilical cord
pickled in a jar. Plopped
in brine years ago
like the frog in the pond
in his famous haiku.
Of course
fame meant nothing
to him. He stood
in the blazing rain
in his family graveyard
and as a crow squawked overhead
the stones proclaimed him
the last of his line. He
kept feeling inside his
straw raincoat for a missing
limb or the hole where
the wind and rain
flew in. I'll get drunk
tonight, he thought,
and his eyelashes glistened
as he trudged back
to his hermit's hut
to gaze again at the jar.

I like to lie with you wordless
on black cloud rooft beach
in late june 5 o’clock tempest
on clump weed bed with sand
fitting your contours like tailor made

and I like to wash my summer brown face
in north cold hudson rapids
with octagon soap
knees niched in steamy rocks
where last night’s frog stared
at our buddhist sleep

but most of all I like to see
the morning happen . . .

I like to go down vertical mountains
where lanny goshkitch
meditated
crashing poplars
sap sticky arms flailing
as thermosed green tea
anoints sneakers
and blood soakt brow I taste and love
myself a split second

and I like to feel my own full scrotum
as I horizon the whole crisp linen earth
in my beatitude waiting miguel-like
in maskt fantasy for christ-like
you—
whoever you are

but most of all I like to see
the morning happen . . .

I like to look at books howl
haikus of the seasons
of the mind
that I might know the knowing
and the simplest to think of all of us
taking turns at catching each other
in the rye

and I like to taste cold absinthe
on hot hung sunday mornings
discussing orgies symposiums
and sounds with hoary headed poets
in upstairs jazz club
in Japan

but most of all I like to see
the morning happen when k and ike still sleep
and only the denver night riders hum contrasts
to orient jazzy feather beasts
in the dewy garden of real earth
where I can sink my naked feet
cool

Here’s what I had in mind, kōtiro, this
clipping at words like overgrown maikuku — 
return the blankets of domestic life; don’t fold
washing or wear shoes, polish these rerenga kē.
Eh. But this world.
I s’pose neither of us planned to be in politics,
never did do what others told us to — 
wahanui though, go on, get
your sedition on girl,
your agitator, your defiant speak
to each other eye to eye — 
Māori been jailed for nouns, phrases;
butcher up a clause, get buried
in Pākehā kupu, then dig that
out like the old people. No one approved
of their language either.
