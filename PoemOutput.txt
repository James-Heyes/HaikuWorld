Haiku

By Frank Lima

For Frank O'Hara

I The lights are out The cats are hungry The room is full of gangsters II The dishes are dirty The icebox is empty I dream of celery and a compass III The roof is upstairs The window next door A guitar in the shower IV The hours disappear in my room Where is my blue pistol The door-god is knocking.

Haiku

By Etheridge Knight

1 Eastern guard tower glints in sunset; convicts rest like lizards on rocks. 2 The piano man is stingy, at 3 A.M. his songs drop like plum. 3 Morning sun slants cell. Drunks stagger like cripple flies On jailhouse floor. 4 To write a blues song is to regiment riots and pluck gems from graves. 5 A bare pecan tree slips a pencil shadow down a moonlit snow slope. 6 The falling snow flakes Cannot blunt the hard aches nor Match the steel stillness. 7 Under moon shadows A tall boy flashes knife and Slices star bright ice. 8 In the August grass Struck by the last rays of sun The cracked teacup screams. 9 Making jazz swing in Seventeen syllables AIN’T No square poet’s job.

Haiku

By Henri Cole

After the sewage flowed into the sea and took the oxygen away, the fishes fled, but the jellies didn’t mind. They stayed and ate up the food the fishes left behind. I sat on the beach in my red pajamas and listened to the sparkling foam, like feelings being fustigated. Nearby, a crayfish tugged on a string. In the distance, a man waved. Unnatural cycles seemed to be establishing themselves, without regard to our lives. Deep inside, I could feel a needle skip:Autumn dark.Murmur of the saw.Poor humans.

haiku #62

By Scott Helmes

Scott Helmes is a longtime visual poet who has produced works in a variety of forms, including mathematical poetry and rubber-stamped poetry. His "haiku #62" is part of a series of striking poems created from scraps of colored text torn out of glossy magazines and arrayed in three tiers. These tiers approximate the look of haiku, and the text flutters in and out of different colors and typefaces, giving the poems their ineffable beauty.—Geof Huth More About Visual Poetry >>

Selected Haiku by Issa

By Robert Hass

Don’t worry, spiders, I keep housecasually.New Year’s Day— everything is in blossom!I feel about average.The snow is melting and the village is floodedwith children.Goes out,comes back—the love life of a cat.Mosquito at my ear— does he thinkI’m deaf?Under the evening moon the snailis stripped to the waist.Even with insects— some can sing,some can’t.All the time I pray to Buddha I keep onkilling mosquitoes.Napped half the day; no onepunished me!

Three Haiku, Two Tanka

By Philip Appleman

(Kyoto)

CONFIDENCE(after Bashō) Clouds murmur darkly, it is a blinding habit— gazing at the moon.TIME OF JOY(after Buson) Spring means plum blossoms and spotless new kimonos for holiday whores.RENDEZVOUS(after Shiki) Once more as I wait for you, night and icy wind melt into cold rain.FOR SATORI In the spring of joy, when even the mud chuckles, my soul runs rabid, snaps at its own bleeding heels, and barks: “What is happiness?”SOMBER GIRL She never saw fire from heaven or hotly fought with God; but her eyes smolder for Hiroshima and the cold death of Buddha.

Blue Octavo Haiku

By Rachel Wetzsteon

after Kafka

 In fat armchairs sat indolence and impatience, plotting my downfall* A wicked cage flew across the long horizon searching for a bird.* I burned with love in empty rooms, I sternly turned knives within myself.* “Behold the bright gate,” the keeper said. “I am now going to shut it.”* Hardly was the road swept clean when ah! there appeared new piles of dry leaves.* But nothing could kill a faith like a guillotine, as heavy, as light.* Happiness? Finding your indestructible core; leaving it alone.* Into the heavens flew a breathless legion of impossible crows.

Carrie Leigh’s Hugh Hefner Haikus

By Lynn Crosbie

Hef brings me flowers tiger lilies, ochre veined downcast, sleek black cups small shadows, are the puckers in his pyjamas where his skin caves in tired profligate, I sigh and pour the oil along your circular sheets thinking of all the times, or women on this bed glossy old bunnies I imagine their breasts, plate of fried eggs, a row of tonsured monks’ heads his tongue slithers, gaunt voluptuary, ugly old man, my eyes close when I roll his name Ner. along my tongue, like the line of cold test tubes thin bottled semen, he wants to plant it, deeply in my flat belly Hugh junior, and, or Carietta, a child is packed in dry blue ice in silk pyjamas they have an emperor’s crest it is dark in there but it’s cold as the green jacuzzi, bubbles are clouds on its face I will crush the glass with the fingers in his back and pile on my rings and all the fur coats and move down the circular stairs, bloated with gold the flowers are a venus-flytrap, with red curls flames and noxious breath his betrayal gives me granite fists, girls scatter movie stars crumple as I run away, from the gaudy prison cell, of tinsel and skin I’ll sue him and write and build a home, in the desert, on the sun a sequined empress, a mirage—in loungewear and harlequin glasses

How Spring Comes

By Alice Notley

Toys and roseThe zoo body zigzags I think fish toobut I'm a polite social being, I'm a Ladle Lady or purple and blue I write green letters and gold editorials for the Krystal Oxygen Company I have one hip as far as I can see, that I see as I write saywhite tee-shirtsupsidedownturn em around& put them onyour musclesmy angelsora semi-colonis blue windowto me is that a haiku? I fly over San Diego in some one or another real despair and ask you to comfort me. You more or less do, you aren't even heremy best me my worldly memy taste of spring my continuance mycomfort will you comfort me? I offer you my heart over TucsonI can't use ittake it to comfort mefreeme be it take it take it tobe it which apparently you don't or take you help provide me it I think, that happens among true people, that poem I was writing no good poembut Moment framed the Pleiades The garnets ring more beautiful the longer youare waiting for me in them,where Deity makes me friendly there. But who put on all the tee-shirts in Hunter's Point? Well we're all good boys my son said so. A semi-colon is a semi-precious garnet cluster telegram; what we love are such depths between all the messages. Pass the salt; Ladies of the Tang, bubble of night; this book about Harry Truman is wonderful. I see the Gulf Moon Rising every night. I'm familiar with the zonked starfish. I've the sheen on under the fire-escape railing all streetlight-lit. The hollow suddenly appeared to enlarge and fill with a bright light. Wild with the taste of wine it does not remember the despair of an hour ago, which was true that is of a true woman. She was somehow hating her position on the round earth in the dusky sky on a harsh Sunday. On the ground forgotten flowerlike firmaments. She addressed in uneloquent hatred SMUG LIFEthe one who soothes one's foolishness the Great Face Construct who loves you for your kinks child anyway, the Guru God:Oh I will come back a knockout tomorrowUseless to you!You're not it you smug faceI'm not doing your yoga not wearingYour moondrops using your creamRinse letting you fuck me ExquisiteLike I was one of the Ones With Brains Too!Intelligence in panties with peekabooholes—No I'm coming back rawI'm getting drenched in the rainIt's rain and it's wet I'm soaked I'mChilled and I'm coughing the air's rawTo my throat, which is raw fromCoughing, coughing so strongCoughing and laughingSo strong from killing you!  Etc.She didn't kill nothing.& I don't get to share no secrets with the stars. I make chow. I contemplate semi-colons. I despair as a mother. I scream at that kid I'm gonna crack open your big walnut if you don't go to sleep. Theories of grace, that it implies no surprise no shock. Ukrainians sudden on Sunday speaking Ukrainian, the cross not Christian but Graciousand when I want to cry or cough violently it must diffuse back into my embassy; hard, that takes hard. And if it weren't for you . . . not you smug life face, but real you. Please play cribbage.Pass the salt.Think of a garnet-black cabbage, a Ukrainian is selling it on 7th Street in honor of our marriage. A Spanish fan opens in my abdomenI have Spanish dancers in my stomachthey're my arching striving in dance where it's black red flowers darken to be huge pleasuring thesevere, tried Angel who meets transition,transport, as abruptly as necessaryfor everyone's are apt Says the Unassuming Graceful Whose down-hip-ness Is that window The dancers' sensuous flaw That admits Spring, Contingent upon our personality Spring is for the worldlyjust like the HaHa RoomJust like dearest rockbottomsuddenly gone buoyantTo be black geese to bestrenuous dancersis not to dignify a passion but togrip it.Not saints but always pupils pupils dilated fully black in full achievement of gut-feeling. Joy.

The Beatitudes of Malibu

By Rowan Ricardo Phillips

i Walking across the PCH, we lookedUp and saw, big as the butt of a pen,Jupiter, fat with light and unheighted.I looked back at the waiting traffic stalledAt the seaside road’s salt-rimmed traffic lightsAs they swayed to the Pacific’s not-quite-Anapestic song of sea and air — The raw and sudden crick of crickets — The cars, suddenly silent as cows — And blue Malibu blackening like a bee.ii A poem is a view of the PacificAnd the Pacific, and the PacificTaking in its view of the Pacific,And the Pacific as the Pacific(Just like that: as though there’s no Pacific)Ends. A poem is the palm of the ocean,Closing. It or she or he is merely,Which means it or she or he is a mar.But a mar made up oftemperament andTempo — the red weather in the heart.iii I’m about to get this all wrong, I know:Santa Monica behind me, the oceanTo my left, Jupiter high above me,And Malibu somewhere in my mind, fleckedWith mist and dusk and Dylan and strange graysIn the sunsets that stripe the seaside hillsLike the tricolor of a country madeOfbeauty, the dream of beauty, and smog.Sadly, in my mind it’s always snowing;Which is beautiful but austere, unlike here.iv Along the thin pedestrian passageBeside the PCH, just off Sunset,Mel Gibson chants of beginnings and endsAnd lies and facts — Jews and Blacks beingBoth the lies and facts. His face is ruddyLike bruschetta. He storms at the policeBecause fuck them. He’s wearing his T-shirtLike a toga. He schools them his togaWisdom from toga times. He offers themHis toga. They offer him a ride — .v Arun’s car carried us like metaphorIn a poem or painting; moving meaning;Moving the current; being the current;The terse tug of tides: still the great glamour;Still, even as we speed on the 110,The music in my head, the JupiterOf the mind’s unstemmed Pacific OceanAs it unfurls in the vapor trail ofMalibu, fragrant in far-off fluorescents,Like a nocturnal flower calling you.vi Then, Downtown LA and LA Live surgedUp, like marginalia on a newlyTurned page, spangled with bland suggestions,Fiery accusations of its ownBrilliance that descend into indifference.We speed nearer and it grows. We veer andIt grows. We park and it grows. Close your eyes.Now look. And it has grown. Yo la quiero.But I should know better, if just becauseYou can smell the injustice in the air.vii The Pacific encircles me. Slowly.As though it doesn’t trust me. Or, betterSaid, I only understand it this way:By feeling like a stranger at its blueDoor. The poet with the sea stuck in hisEnjambments can’t call out to some CathayAs though some Cathay exists and be glad.No, the differences we have should be feltAnd made, through that feeling, an eclipsed lack;A power to take in what you can’t take back.viii The old hocus of this ocean’s focusOn pulling its waves over the soft surfLike a skin pulled down tight over the topOf a drum was, to her, a new hocus.We stared out with her, out toward Hokusai’sTiny boats and rising lace-fringed sea swellsNo chunk of haiku could think to charter.It was like the eighth day of creationIn the eighth line of a poem — she sang,She didn’t sing, the sea sang, then stopped.

Frightening Things

By David Mura

After wandering years Basho returned to gaze at his umbilical cord pickled in a jar. Plopped in brine years ago like the frog in the pond in his famous haiku. Of course fame meant nothing to him. He stood in the blazing rain in his family graveyard and as a crow squawked overhead the stones proclaimed him the last of his line. He kept feeling inside his straw raincoat for a missing limb or the hole where the wind and rain flew in. I'll get drunk tonight, he thought, and his eyelashes glistened as he trudged back to his hermit's hut to gaze again at the jar.

Impossible to Tell

Launch Audio in a New Window

By Robert Pinsky

To Robert Hass and in Memory of Elliot Gilbert

Slow dulcimer, gavotte and bow, in autumn, Bashō and his friends go out to view the moon; In summer, gasoline rainbow in the gutter, The secret courtesy that courses like ichor Through the old form of the rude, full-scale joke, Impossible to tell in writing. “Bashō” He named himself, “Banana Tree”: banana After the plant some grateful students gave him, Maybe in appreciation of his guidance Threading a long night through the rules and channels Of their collaborative linking-poem Scored in their teacher’s heart: live, rigid, fluid Like passages etched in a microscopic circuit. Elliot had in his memory so many jokes They seemed to breed like microbes in a culture Inside his brain, one so much making another It was impossible to tell them all: In the court-culture of jokes, a top banana. Imagine a court of one: the queen a young mother, Unhappy, alone all day with her firstborn child And her new baby in a squalid apartment Of too few rooms, a different race from her neighbors. She tells the child she’s going to kill herself. She broods, she rages. Hoping to distract her, The child cuts capers, he sings, he does imitations Of different people in the building, he jokes, He feels if he keeps her alive until the father Gets home from work, they’ll be okay till morning. It’s laughter versus the bedroom and the pills. What is he in his efforts but a courtier? Impossible to tell his whole delusion. In the first months when I had moved back East From California and had to leave a message On Bob’s machine, I used to make a habit Of telling the tape a joke; and part-way through, I would pretend that I forgot the punchline, Or make believe that I was interrupted— As though he’d be so eager to hear the end He‘d have to call me back. The joke was Elliot’s, More often than not. The doctors made the blunder That killed him some time later that same year. One day when I got home I found a message On my machine from Bob. He had a story About two rabbis, one of them tall, one short, One day while walking along the street together They see the corpse of a Chinese man before them, And Bob said, sorry, he forgot the rest. Of course he thought that his joke was a dummy, Impossible to tell—a dead-end challenge. But here it is, as Elliot told it to me: The dead man’s widow came to the rabbis weeping, Begging them, if they could, to resurrect him. Shocked, the tall rabbi said absolutely not. But the short rabbi told her to bring the body Into the study house, and ordered the shutters Closed so the room was night-dark. Then he prayed Over the body, chanting a secret blessing Out of Kabala. “Arise and breathe,” he shouted; But nothing happened. The body lay still. So then The little rabbi called for hundreds of candles And danced around the body, chanting and praying In Hebrew, then Yiddish, then Aramaic. He prayed In Turkish and Egyptian and Old Galician For nearly three hours, leaping about the coffin In the candlelight so that his tiny black shoes Seemed not to touch the floor. With one last prayer Sobbed in the Spanish of before the Inquisition He stopped, exhausted, and looked in the dead man’s face. Panting, he raised both arms in a mystic gesture And said, “Arise and breathe!” And still the body Lay as before. Impossible to tell In words how Elliot’s eyebrows flailed and snorted Like shaggy mammoths as—the Chinese widow Granting permission—the little rabbi sang The blessing for performing a circumcision And removed the dead man’s foreskin, chanting blessings In Finnish and Swahili, and bathed the corpse From head to foot, and with a final prayer In Babylonian, gasping with exhaustion, He seized the dead man’s head and kissed the lips And dropped it again and leaping back commanded, “Arise and breathe!” The corpse lay still as ever. At this, as when Bashō’s disciples wind Along the curving spine that links the renga Across the different voices, each one adding A transformation according to the rules Of stasis and repetition, all in order And yet impossible to tell beforehand, Elliot changes for the punchline: the wee Rabbi, still panting, like a startled boxer, Looks at the dead one, then up at all those watching, A kind of Mel Brooks gesture: “Hoo boy!” he says, “Now that’s what I call really dead.” O mortal Powers and princes of earth, and you immortal Lords of the underground and afterlife, Jehovah, Raa, Bol-Morah, Hecate, Pluto, What has a brilliant, living soul to do with Your harps and fires and boats, your bric-a-brac And troughs of smoking blood? Provincial stinkers, Our languages don’t touch you, you’re like that mother Whose small child entertained her to beg her life. Possibly he grew up to be the tall rabbi, The one who washed his hands of all those capers Right at the outset. Or maybe he became The author of these lines, a one-man renga The one for whom it seems to be impossible To tell a story straight. It was a routine Procedure. When it was finished the physicians Told Sandra and the kids it had succeeded, But Elliot wouldn’t wake up for maybe an hour, They should go eat. The two of them loved to bicker In a way that on his side went back to Yiddish, On Sandra’s to some Sicilian dialect. He used to scold her endlessly for smoking. When she got back from dinner with their children The doctors had to tell them about the mistake. Oh swirling petals, falling leaves! The movement Of linking renga coursing from moment to moment Is meaning, Bob says in his Haiku book. Oh swirling petals, all living things are contingent,Falling leaves, and transient, and they suffer. But the Universal is the goal of jokes, Especially certain ethnic jokes, which taper Down through the swirling funnel of tongues and gestures Toward their preposterous Ithaca. There’s one A journalist told me. He heard it while a hero Of the South African freedom movement was speaking To elderly Jews. The speaker’s own right arm Had been blown off by right-wing letter-bombers. He told his listeners they had to cast their ballots For the ANC—a group the old Jews feared As “in with the Arabs.” But they started weeping As the old one-armed fighter told them their country Needed them to vote for what was right, their vote Could make a country their children could return to From London and Chicago. The moved old people Applauded wildly, and the speaker’s friend Whispered to the journalist, “It’s the Belgian Army Joke come to life.” I wish that I could tell it To Elliot. In the Belgian Army, the feud Between the Flemings and Walloons grew vicious, So out of hand the army could barely function. Finally one commander assembled his men In one great room, to deal with things directly. They stood before him at attention. “All Flemings,” He ordered, “to the left wall.” Half the men Clustered to the left. “Now all Walloons,” he ordered, “Move to the right.” An equal number crowded Against the right wall. Only one man remained At attention in the middle: “What are you, soldier?” Saluting, the man said, “Sir, I am a Belgian.” “Why, that’s astonishing, Corporal—what’s your name?” Saluting again, “Rabinowitz,” he answered: A joke that seems at first to be a story About the Jews. But as the renga describes Religious meaning by moving in drifting petals And brittle leaves that touch and die and suffer The changing winds that riffle the gutter swirl, So in the joke, just under the raucous music Of Fleming, Jew, Walloon, a courtly allegiance Moves to the dulcimer, gavotte and bow, Over the banana tree the moon in autumn— Allegiance to a state impossible to tell.

A Phonecall from Frank O’Hara

Launch Audio in a New Window

By Anne Waldman

“That all these dyings may be life in death”

I was living in San FranciscoMy heart was in Manhattan It made no sense, no reference pointHearing the sad horns at night,fragile evocations of female stuffThe 3 tones (the last most resonant) were like warnings, haiku-muezzins at dawn The call came in the afternoon“Frank, is that really you?” I'd awake chilled at dawn in the wooden house like an old shipStay bundled through the day sitting on the stoop to catch the sun I lived near the park whose deep greenover my shoulder made life coolerWas my spirit faltering, grown duller? I want to be free of poetry's ornaments,its duty, free of constant irritation,me in it, what was grander reasonfor being? Do it, why? (Why, Frank?)To make the energies dance etc. My coat a cape of horrors I'd walk through town or impending earthquake. Was that it?Ominous days. Street shiny withhallucinatory light on sad dogs, too many religious people, or a womanstartled me by her look of indecisionnear the empty stadium I walked back spooked by my own darkness Then Frank called to say “What? Not done complaining yet?Can't you smell the eucalyptus, have you never neared the Pacific?‘While frank and free/call for musick while your veins swell’”he sang, quoting a metaphysician"Don't you know the secret, how towake up and see you don't exist, butthat does, don't you see phenomenais so much more important than this?I always love that.” “Always?” I cried, wanting to believe him“Yes.” “But say more! How can you ifit's sad & dead?” “But that's just it!If! It isn't. It doesn't want to be Do you want to be?” He was warming to his song“Of course I don't have to put up with asmuch as you do these days. These years.But I do miss the color, the architecture,the talk. You know, it was the life!And dying is such an insult. After allI was in love with breath and I lovedembracing those others, the lovers,with my body.” He sighed & laughedHe wasn't quite as I'd remembered himNot less generous, but more abstractDid he even have a voice now, I wonderedor did I think it up in the middleof this long day, phone in hand nowdialing Manhattan

Being in Plays

By Ed Skoog

Ethics are learned from who you sleep with the first few times, and theater is sex, almost. Being in it, I mean, and being young, with a lot of group undressing and silence in darkness, chaste permissions of the cast party, spiked punch in the recreation room.  I was always cast as Old Man with tennis-shoe polish for white hair and lines drawn where my lines now are, forehead haiku, the eyes' briffits, and parentheses around the muzzle. I guess I miss it, achievement's sense, the way a show's run ends and everyone knows it together,  a social pain, like the death of a popular imaginary friend.  When lights between scenes dim, I like to see actors take props offstage or team up with stagehands to move  the built elements of our fantasy. I hope they keep going, and sneak some of the properties home to mix in with their private dramas. I pass theaters the way I pass churches, but like  better this foldable theater half-constructed in the mind, sometimes thrown away along with the day's receipts.  Nothing's lost. I carry my own props in—red telephone, bowl of apples—and then with me draw back into the unseen.

"You Don't Know What Love Is"

By Bill Zavatsky

For Rebecca Feldman and Brian Roessler

That's what the first line says of the song I've been playing all summer at the keyboard—trying to get my hands around its dark, melancholy chords, its story line of a melody that twists up like snakes from melodic minor scales that I've also been trying to learn, though I'm no great shakes as a practicer of scales. Come to think of it, neither am I much when it comes to love—no great shakes, I mean. Not that I haven't had my chances. Twenty years married, I made a lousy husband, half asleep, selfish, more like a big baby than a grown man, the poet laureate of the self-induced coma when it came to doing anything for anybody but me. "Now and then he took his thumb out of his mouth to write an ode to or a haiku about the thumb he sucked all day." That's what I imagined my ex-wife said to our therapist near the end. She did say: "It's all about Bill." She was right. And suddenly it frightens me, remembering how, at our wedding, our poet friends read poems of (mostly) utter depression to salute us. I wondered if their griefs in love had double-crossed our union, if strange snakes in the grass of our blissful Eden had hissed at us, and now I worry, on your wedding day, if I'm not doing the same damned thing . . . . I haven't come to spring up and put my curse on your bliss. Here's what I want to say: You're young. You don’t know what love is. And as the next line of the song goes, you won't —"Until you know the meaning of the blues." Darlings, the blues will come (though not often, I hope) to raise their fiery swords against your paradise. A little of that you unwittingly got today, when it rained and you couldn't be married outside under the beautiful tree in Nan and Alan's yard. But paradise doesn't have to be structured so that we can never reenter it. After you've kicked each other out of it once or twice (I'm speaking metaphorically, of course), teach yourself how to say a few kind words to each other. Don't stand there angry, stony. Each of you let the other know what you are feeling and thinking and then it may be possible to return to each other smiling, hand in hand. For arm in arm, you are your best Eden. Remember the advice the old poet sang to you on the afternoon of August 4, 2001, the day you got married. May you enjoy a good laugh thinking of him and his silver thumb now that you've turned the key into your new life in the beautiful Massachusetts rain and—hey, now—sun!

Time Traveler’s Haibun: 1989

Launch Audio in a New Window

By Maureen Thorson

In the grassy space between the wings of the elementary school and the trailers housing the fifth grade’s overflow classrooms, girls flip their hair in imitation of Cindy Crawford, sing Iko Iko. None of you know what it means or where the song comes from.
It’s honor-roll season, a time of outings to TCBY and Outback Steakhouse. Your mother warns you against filling up on bread, but it’s hard to resist the little brown loaves brought warm to the table with soft butter – a luxury that cannot be imagined at home, with its always-refrigerated margarine and Pepperidge Farm sandwich loaves.
Everyone knows what’s popular but nobody knows how to act. At ten, you lack any context. The world swims before you, and it constantly stings. Its favorite barb: “everybody knows that.”
Beyond the grassy space of girls is more grass, a quarter-mile loop of track, a church with a painfully white spire, a fence, and a neighborhood maybe a little less nice than yours, crammed between the school and busy Great Neck Road. The fence is of chain link, instead of wooden slats. That’s how you know about the niceness – that and the something hard, like a grain of sand, you feel in your mother’s voice, when she takes you to the school’s Spring Fling, where you win another goldfish. They always die, but you’re getting better. Now, it takes a while.Loblollies shiverIn May heat. The world’s ending.The world’s a mirage.

The Pact

By Adrian Castro

1.
The candle will be our medium for dialogue
We must always
be on speaking terms
2.
When you see the candle by the bedside burning
it will be my message to you:
Do Not Touch!
3.
You will heal through herbs &
the words I give you to
spray unto the solution
4.
Never dress in black
I may mistake you for
someone ready to die
5.
As much as possible
 do not speak wickedly or damn anyone
6.
As much as possible
stay away from funerals
I like to work alone
Death is death’s work (Iku n’iku che)
7.
Egun will be my messenger
8.
You may also petition me
through that white staff
you know the one—
with bells & snail shells
You also know the chant
9.
Do not be tempted by possessions & titles
If you have patience
I will make possible
those you actually
will need
10.
Remember this pact
& I will give you health & long life (aiku)
All this was negotiated just prior to his birth. He probably kneeled before the Owner of the Sky while Iku, his patron Orisha, and many Egun sat watching with fly whisks in hand and full regalia (after all, one of their own was about to embark on his journey to the human world). The ilé aiyé.
He probably placed in circular fashion inside a big calabash all his choices, probably whispered into the gourd a slow "Ashé tó iba Eshu." We say probably because one thing is for sure, El Niño does not remember the details. In fact no one does (except
the deities & Iku). No one remembers the details of their creation. No one remembers the destiny, the mission they chose, their personal Orisha, and most importantly the date of their last breath.
Memory & continuity. Keeping el hilo de la conversación. Never losing the wavy & fragile link that keeps you grounded to yr root. The dialogue with spirits that may tap yr left shoulder & all that. But no one remembers. No one remembers. Ésto si es trágico.
In order to recall the details of what went on in the other world, to map his destiny, El Niño must be taken for divination. And even then one session won’t do it. The story will get revealed as his life turns each page & changes rhythm & the oracle is cast several more times. So they took El Niño to the diviner Edikán's house. After pouring libations & reciting the necessary ayuba prayers—greeting the creator, the ancestors, the divination, earth, wind, river, ocean, jungle, & crossroad orishas, Edikán cast
the divining chain/ópele used by the babalawo. A picture began to emerge. He said the Orishas & Egun, collectively called ara orun or citizens of the other world, have given us certain verses & stories to deliver messages regarding the rhythms of our lives. He said El Niño’s patron deity is Oshun but he will always have an affinity with Ogun & Obatalá. But most prominent is his close relationship with Egun, that is, the ancestors, Iku’s messengers. He said it would be through a kinship with Egun that he would accomplish his most difficult tasks; even the arts of divination. He will be a mouthpiece for Egun.
Edikán said El Niño has a predisposition to a vivid imagination. Because of this there are & will be mysterious phenomena happening to him like visions & dreams of secret songs. He will not regard them as strange.
He said El Niño should be taught even at an early age the rigors of an herbalist. He should be taught at least how to recognize certain trees & plants, the healing properties of the most commonly used herbs, their harvesting times, how they mix & with what substances. All this will eventually lead to an encyclopedic knowledge not only of their healing properties but of their ability to alter the invisible rhythms that underlie most things.
Edikán said there will be certain resguardos that must be prepared so as to begin bridging the gap between Orishas, Iku, Egun, & himself. Even though El Niño’s inner head/ori inu chose a good destiny in the other world, such destiny must be aligned with his physical head/ori in this world. It will be Orishas & Egun that will focus his life & help him fulfill the destiny he chose in the other world. He said beginning with the feet El Niño must be securely fastened to the earth so as to not depart too soon for the other world. (You see there is always the detail of Iku being overprotective. The relationship is like playing with a leopard—even an affectionate jab with its paw will cause a scar). The head will also have to be ritually prepared & fed with bits of white fruit among other ingredients & thus given a firm root, stability—“para que su cabeza no esté en el aire,” he said.
We were witness to this event. We heard what needed to be done. There was actually a time, maybe this is still going on, when people consulted with the spirit world, the other world, on such occasions as the third month after birth. We collected the ingredients that would shape his destiny & began to assemble them. Much of them were from the river, the jungle, & of course, the cemetery. We heard what needed to
be done.
Ara Orun are hip to the images & subtle rhythms that stories & verses evoke. The same images & subtle rhythms running through our lives. Edikán said that barring some details of modernity, his life would follow a certain ancient story pertaining to the divination—
Ofun is like this/
Ofun ni jé bé—
The page continues to turn.The rhythm, the rhythm
will come from dreams.

Sedition — a letter to the writer from Meri Mangakāhia

Here’s what I had in mind, kōtiro, this clipping at words like overgrown maikuku —  return the blankets of domestic life; don’t fold washing or wear shoes, polish these rerenga kē. Eh. But this world. I s’pose neither of us planned to be in politics, never did do what others told us to —  wahanui though, go on, get your sedition on girl, your agitator, your defiant speak to each other eye to eye —  Māori been jailed for nouns, phrases; butcher up a clause, get buried in Pākehā kupu, then dig that out like the old people. No one approved of their language either.

Ghana

Where the Bead Speaks

My uncle was the prophetic one, throwing his beads this way and that, diving, foretelling, warnings galore, sweet promising. One eye on the past, four to the future, half a dozen or more for now. He was good if the news was good; for evil news we blamed the beads. Made from bones or fashioned glass, cut out from stones or beaten brass It’s the many human hours, Sister, it’s the sweat and blood, Brother, which makes the bead a thing apart from precious diamonds, opals, and gold. Turn them this way, shake them that way, see how they shine incandescent, see how they glow in a million hues. Elegant and enchanting bead, flowered flawed, folded, or fielded, you are the true frame of our feasts, your festivals, fetes, and fiestas. Give me a bead that’s wrapped in joy; find me a bead to carry my grief. We sing of beads, and sing with beads; just see how well they show on us. Beads are the zeze of our joyous trails, the ziz of life when all else fails. Beads are zany, zesty, zingy, the greatest zaiku, a grief zapper. Speak to me of beads, Grandma, speak to me. Talk to me of beads, Nana, talk to me. She brightened up immediately, she looked at me with a welcome smile. Grandma pulled up a stool and sat, she listened well to me and asked: “You want a tale on beads, do you? You want a tale or two? I’ll tell a tale or two to you. But to speak to you of every bead, in words that sing and dance like them, you and I shall surely need more than my life in hours and days, more than your life in weeks and years. A million lifetimes is not much if beads are the theme, the thought, the thing. We dive for beads, we swim, we float, we mine for beads, we comb the woods. Koli beads for the infant on his wrist and on her waist, cascades of white beads for the mother, a very fitting celebrant. There are beads that are tame like what welcomed baby here; there are beads that are wild, lion’s teeth, lightning struck. And there are beads around my waist, For only my and my dot-dot’s eyes!! Have you seen my love tonight? Asked the ardent warrior youth. Light of step, curved like a bow, her eyes were wonders to behold. She was oiled and very clean, she was powdered like a queen, she wore a sarong of the purest silk, her toes were nestled in their thongs. Have you seen my love tonight? She who wore gold beads in her hair? Then the pretty maiden asked, who has seen my love tonight? Who has seen my warrior brave? he had said no more to war, he had buried his arrowhead. His girdle was free of blood and sweat. He was adorned in his very best, he was oiled like a king, with beads of silver in his hair. Who has seen my love tonight? They welcome us here in the palest white and bid us farewell in black, sometimes blue, and brown, and red, metallic green, or indigo. There are beads, by far the most, that are polished, tarred, and feathered. There are beads, worked over and under, elegant hued, thin and narrow. Beads are the zaffered, the zingiest, the zenith of all great times. Cool, calm, and forever collected, clawed, clayed, or colored, constantly changing, bead you are the best, you are the greatest. So don’t talk to me of the chevron. Don’t ever talk of it. Don’t break my ears on the chevron. Don’t break my ears!!! As barter for my life and yours, no gem on earth could fit the bill. Not gold, and if not even gold, then what on earth is chevron? I dread the chevron. It was a weapon of oppression, and not at all . . . a bead. Seven whole humans for one bead? And what kind of trade was that? A layer each of sand and mud for the lives of our kinsmen? So what if it was one and not seven? One soul for a shiny piece of bead? This sounds like the greatest greed, this sounds like utter foolishness! Don’t talk to me of the chevron, don’t even mention it. Don’t break my ears on the chevron, don’t break my ears. They say that cheap beads prattle, rattle, and tattle, but great beads never talk. Yet if a string of beads is fine, it sings, it dances, it jumps, and sizzles. If a string of beads is truly fine, it can speak in a million tongues. It will have something for all, and say the most amazing things. And every now and every then every bead laughs out aloud.There are beads that are smaller than the hopes of a mean mind. Though called bodom, as in a dog, poochy pug, puggy pooch, bodom beads, they are so big, they are the elephants of the pack. They lead the way and announce the day. The nature of beads is a mystery, the how of it, the feel, the glow of earthly gems: the least and most, our first and true try to create, to beautify our human selves. The best of doors to human hearts, our spirit’s window to the world, beads clothe our woes in vivid color. Beads like angels plead for us. Beads can lift the heaviest heart. And like tea and precious brews, beads can warm us when we are cold, and cool us when we are hot. Blessed are the beads that bring us peace. Spare us, O Lord, in this lifetime, beads of war, chaos, and strife. No beaded strings of calamities, earthquakes, floods, and famine. No veritable tsunamis of woe. Keep us cool and keep us warm. For each color in the rainbow, there is a bead, somewhere on earth: a million years old, if a day, or shy in its newsness, and done this dawn. Blue beads, green beads, yellow beads and grey, black beads, white beads, red beads and brown. Your rise from heaps of your own ash with more of you than ever were. You, bead, are an awesome one, you are the phoenix of the years. Their making uses endless hours, the how, the when, the what of it. The wearing is by a billion souls whichever way, however much, and everywhere . . . Mined and molten man-made wonder, raw organic, or cooked, and dried, forever treasured, forever prized. Bettered and bartered, broken and beaten, burnt or badgered, bruised and bloodied you are the never-left-behind, oldest, ordered, owned invention. Pure and precious, polished pearl, still safe, sacred, scraped, or scratched; Traded, treated, tough in trouble, unique, unmatched, unbreakable. Verdant velvet, virginal as rain, beads are virile, vestal, vain. Gilded and golden, there can be no palanquin. If you are not sitting with the king, you are the queen, the soul, and spirit within. Beads are deserving, beads are worthy, wash me some beads to warm my skin, a token of love, a gift for my kin. Hollowed and hallowed, jingled, jangled, juggled, you are our life’s companion, the closest friend until the end. Don’t tell me if there were no beads something else could meet our needs. Something what? Something where? Please keep it there, even if it’s rare.
