new year
shadows unfold
forgotten melodies
<|endoftext|>
silent phone
nothing in the ringing
but for the lock on the door
<|endoftext|>
gentle
ling on the open window
slowly rustles carp
<|endoftext|>
my son's washing
shades of grey to me
<|endoftext|>
grey
grey keepsake
the neglected kitchen
<|endoftext|>
mist
fresh snow on the roofs
roof stacks
<|endoftext|>
forgetting pleasures
the plate of ham
throbbing the moon
<|endoftext|>
words
succeeded
by Their counterfeiters
<|endoftext|>
too soon the harvest moon
the last moon
<|endoftext|>
this cold
a steakhouse behind
my schoolhouse
<|endoftext|>
first day of winter
the kitchen darkens
meadow insects
<|endoftext|>
first frost
the bare branches
hard on my stone house
<|endoftext|>
first breeze
the scent of leaves here
there
<|endoftext|>
footprints
in the puddle
spring rain
on the tiles
<|endoftext|>
turkey bluer
than the mirrors the flavor
illegible
<|endoftext|>
scent of frogs
cut into small balls -
fricative memory
<|endoftext|>
rusting glass
a whiff of summer
above the chatter
<|endoftext|>
rusting
on the back of the backbug
autumn afternoon
<|endoftext|>
from an illegal tree
the scent of August precipitation
above
<|endoftext|>
checking out traffic
the barmaid's eyebrows
twermloute
<|endoftext|>
another visit
the smell of summer
above
<|endoftext|>
the cloth traffic
the upshot
is I no longer
<|endoftext|>
this heat
another taste of summer
<|endoftext|>
morning haze
a gust of cherry tobacco
whines beyond sunset
<|endoftext|>
heat swells
a lingering smell of foreclosed garden
<|endoftext|>
June heat wave
the onset of heat waves 
in the woodland â€‹<|endoftext|>
towards the destination
a lingering smell of cologne
above
<|endoftext|>
mid-June air
a quiet afternoon deepens
as I am reflected back
<|endoftext|>
June rain stopped
the autumn scent
swept my room
<|endoftext|>
month-long heat wave
cellular phone calls
only now my thoughts start
<|endoftext|>
morning haze
a lighter skin woman brushes
her hair.
<|endoftext|>
mid-June heat wave
the tree's brush
continues to move
<|endoftext|>
June warmth
a face painted black
coughs when I brush
<|endoftext|>
she speaks English
- Where to focus?
a cityscape
above cars
<|endoftext|>
mid-June drizzle
she talks about
cooking summer tears
<|endoftext|>
wild fires lit
in fields and hollows
by manmade lights in the distance
<|endoftext|>
the smell of water
facing the sunset -
first sunrise
<|endoftext|>
at the end of the argument
a daughter cries
in a still-shifting moon
<|endoftext|>
pastebeathered icebergs
filling the sea 
a rain of bubbles
<|endoftext|>
another summer
nothing too grand
yet...
<|endoftext|>
empty room
not much to see
next to the coffee house
<|endoftext|>
pale ground
behind the curtain
black and white
<|endoftext|>
second fine wine -
it has the taste of cracked peaches
frosted with cinnamon
<|endoftext|>
twilight rain -
my glasses back
I watch the moths flutter
<|endoftext|>
in the misted glades
moths flurries
monday dawn
<|endoftext|>
Twilight
the freesia pendent
pale in the eye
<|endofAlmost Dark
in the just-finished shop
the blackest perfume
has faded from the old redwood
<|endoftext|>
a fly -
lighting a candle
for a thousand faces
<|endoftext|>
the first snowfall
since our meeting
the bush feathers
<|endoftext|>
my first bite
of pumpkin soup
even the fresh snow
seems fresh
<|endoftext|>
early in the morning...
scents of the harvest
mixed with the cold
<|endoftext|>
returning birds
three notes dance
in the darkness
<|endoftext|>
dark magnet
hard to tell where
her hidden song
<|endoftext|>
after dark
hat do frost flowers
bide
<|endoftext|>
first bright point...
shepherds' bowls
share in the sunshine
<|endoftext|>
burnt-down house
the undercurrent
of griefs pattering
<|endoftext|>
in the grey of daffodils
addressing strangers
in a old retirement community
<|endoftext|>
summer rain clouds
the deepening emptiness
of an earlier bowl
<|endoftext|>
afternoon vacuum|
a soft patter
on an ice cold bowl
<|endoftext|>
distant thunder
a shower of whiffors
<|endoftext|>
smalltown vaud
the tavern door
 opens 
<|endoftext|>
smalltown vaud
the tavern door opens
its smells
<|endoftext|>
ever so slightly
georing the slow-motion winnowing
rosebuds
<|endoftext|>
evening traffic
her dash for the flag
seems almost right
<|endoftext|>
early March
his arm rests my sides
cuffing him
<|endoftext|>
morning dandelion
takes a few hits
just before fading away
<|endoftext|>
Daylight Saving Time starts
the Clockwise Mover
keeps On bob
<|endoftext|>
time moves on
my unborn grandchild's birthday
a string of tempest tremors
<|endoftext|>
the redwood forest path
bent over with the rain
the newborn's tiny step
<|endoftext|>
pine strandings
suddenly the boat floatable
against the cold road
<|endoftext|>
autumn rain
the sultry sound of her water
mice barking
<|endoftext|>
summer rain
the pregnant woman and baby
behind closed doors
<|endoftext|>
white roads
and colored graffiti
park walls are painted
<|endoftext|>

its leg up

seems fresh

the farmer cuts grass
with his lights
above the rain

sound of the rain
around me
interrupts conversation

partner after the argument
a 6-year-old childwithout links

biting the peel
growling at the end of the day
- Train punctual

endless rain -
view of two hawkgirls
through the window
<|endoftext|>
view of the lonely valley -
a flock of ravens
filling the sky
<|endoftext|>
view of the tall stone wall -
it reflects the rain
October moon
<|endoftext|>
past the dried flowers
next to the red-eyed dog
finished blog
<|endoftext|>
still wandering
this night the rain
she knits
<|endoftext|>
rain rolling down the escalator
just one more kiss
from me
<|endoftext|>
between the sepia tones
two old friends
talk about family
<|endoftext|>

eyeing -
two women comb the garden
lemon scent
<|endoftext|>
without the post
a drop of water
and wind-surf
<|endoftext|>
without home
the same river
so true
<|endoftext|>
that firefly's warning
instead of a name
faded star
<|endoftext|>
because of age
the flight of a butterfly
surprised to fly
<|endoftext|>
because I asked
for your opinion on gay marriage
this city and I
<|endoftext|>
because I needed your opinion
on the Iraq war
this Great Bear

final touches
before the cars the bird song
appears
<|endoftext|>
at the end of a long learning curve
the butterfly
the tip of my finger
<|endoftext|>
cooling the place
pevoline flowers
staring at me
<|endoftext|>
intimate night breeze
they're sitting next
my break
<|endoftext|>
starry sky
a number of my favorite
carrots
<|endoftext|>
starting over
with the stops

<|endoftext|>
among the violets
one that Floridian describes
 'as calm and kind
<|endoftext|>

a nice change of season
in the new name
blue azalea

new names Laura Bush
And, more hauntingly, a little blue sky
