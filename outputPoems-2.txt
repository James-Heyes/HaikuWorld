at the hands of the trucks
<|endoftext|>
towpath markers
the faded and faded flag
of last year

traffic jam
a boat misses
the sound of all the grain
<|endoftext|>
abandoned school -
the scent of the boarded up barn
footprints
<|endoftext|>
thunderstorms -
the slower the murmur
at the foot of the mailbox
<|endoftext|>
the schoolgirls behind
the mailbox -
his nude breasts
<|endoftext|>
this level -
everything
under his feet
<|endoftext|>
first warming gourd
one firefly
happens to the candle
<|endoftext|>
last Saturday night
the loon splits
the mist
<|endoftext|>
enlightment -
a shadow
at the door
<|endoftext|>
red cupped on the table
out of the light flange
autumn evening
<|endoftext|>
following me
down the line
till the last sap
<|endoftext|>

the last to leave
and just us

fishing line -
the stall
more than I can remember
<|endoftext|>
moon...
my hand lingers
in the stall
<|endoftext|>
too soon...
the moon rises
half a light pole
<|endoftext|>
passing monarchs
the cuckoo's song
still quite white
<|endoftext|>
Reading His Book
on theride the moonlight
for miles and miles
she crawls under the covers
still weeps quietly
<|endoftext|>
the crescent moon
in the rear window
meeting my warning
<|endoftext|>
snowy path
all the petals
declipsed by the stars
<|endoftext|>
jumping ice cubes

for this dream
<|endoftext|>
